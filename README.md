# Polus Scraper

[Polus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeus) and his sister [Phoebe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_(mythology)) were the sources of all intelligence in the beginning of time. Phoebe of prophetic wisdom, and Polus of rational intelligence. Polus' hunger for the facts of the world was insatiable, and he traveled far and wide to expand the scope of his knowledge.

## Purpose

`polus-scrape` is a module designed for use with `polus`, an information discovery platform. It scrapes the web for information that is *(TODO)* then loaded into the `polus` system for application use and analysis.

## Testing

To run the tests in `polus-scrape` as they were meant to be run, please install the [`py.test`](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html) module using [`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or [`easyinstall`](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html):

```
$ pip install -U pytest
# or
$ easy_install -U pytest
```

To test the entire project, navigate to the root directory, and run

```
$ py.test
```

Or, you can run the same command in any of the subdirectories to test specific functionality.
