## The Elasticsearch Query Language

In `polus-scrape`, we will be using a query language based on the [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html). Elasticsearch is a search server based on [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/), a free and open source information retrieval software library from the [Apache Foundation](http://apache.org/).
